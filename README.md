# Multidimensional_scaling
In this exercise, we will look at a dataset of 42 human geographic populations collected by Cavalli-Sforza et al. in The History and Geography of Human Genes, 1994. There are many ways to measure genetic similarity between populations. This work uses the modified Neiâ€™s distance, which compares allele frequencies at specific locations within the human genome. Other ways to measure genetic similarity include the edit distance between DNA sequences or Euclidean distance of gene expressions.
